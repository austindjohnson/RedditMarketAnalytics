# Reddit Market Analytics

This repository holds the data-scraping scripts for the Reddit Market Analytics Dashboard.

The Reddit API script uses the PRAW API wrapper to download "hot" post data from 15 subreddits.

The Yahoo API script uses the yfinance package to download stock price data from the S&P 500 companies at 5-minute intervals.

The dashboard is published online on Tableau Public at: https://public.tableau.com/views/RedditMarketAnalytics/Dashboard
